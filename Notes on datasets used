Notes on datasets used

Original Datasets for the program

The datasets used for this project were: 
  Afrobarometer Rounds 1-7
  https://www.afrobarometer.org/data/merged-data
  
  World Value Surveys Longitudinal Data
  http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSDocumentationWVL.jsp

  ACLED Events data
  https://acleddata.com/data-export-tool
  
Both ACLED and World Value Surveys contain information at the World Level. Afrobarometer has similar institutions that generate
similar but not the exact same surveys in other geographic areas. If thinking on implementing the analysis elsewhere, look
for the appropriate Barometer and compare questionnaires to see feasibility.
